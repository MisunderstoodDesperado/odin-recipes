            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>

            <li>8 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock, or enough to cover potatoes</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="header subtitle">Directions</h3>

        <ol class="list ordered">
            <li>Place bacon in a Dutch oven and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 
                until evenly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Drain bacon pieces on paper towels. Drain 
                off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease.</li>
            <li>Cook celery and onion in the reserved bacon drippings until onion is soft and 
                translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Sauté for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, 
                and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes 
                are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, 
                stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.</li>
            <li>Bring cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened, about 
                5 minutes. Add cream mixture to the potato mixture; stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer about 1/2 of the soup to a blender and purée. Return to the Dutch oven. Adjust 
                seasonings to taste.</li>
        </ol>
